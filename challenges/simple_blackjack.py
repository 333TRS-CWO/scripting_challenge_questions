Complete the simple_blackjack function so that given a list of integers that represent a blackjack hand, return their sum conforming to the rules below. 
    - If the sum is greater than 21 return 0, unless one of the numbers is an 11. 
    - In the case of an 11 it can be converted to a 1 to prevent the sum from exceeding 21. 
    - If an integer received as input is greater than 11, the function should return -1.
