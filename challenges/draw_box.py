'''
Complete the draw_box function so that given a non-negative integer that represents the height and width of a box, 
the function should create an ASCII art box for returning a list of strings.

Then wall of the box should be made up of the "X" character

The interior of the box should be made up of the " "(space) character

Don't try to stack the box, just ensure you return the appropriate strings that could be stacked vertically, given proper formatting.
