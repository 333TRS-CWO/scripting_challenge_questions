Complete the phone_filter function so that given a list of strings representing telephone numbers, the function
counts phone numbers from certain cities (i.e. the 3 digits after the area code conform to specific criteria)

The city we want to count for has a city # that:
    - Starts with a 2,3, or 7
    - Has a middle digit of 7,8, or 9
    - Ends with an even number
